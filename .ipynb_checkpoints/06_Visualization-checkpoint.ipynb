    "# Introduction and generalities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization of the results of an analysis typically tell a lot about the quality of the analysis itself, an example is the claim of [superluminal neutrinos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4897v1.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphics should convey as much information as possible in an intuitive way. There are plenty of bad examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially two kinds of plots you'll ever want to make, histograms and scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms represent scalar functions, $f(x): {\\rm I\\!R}^n \\to {\\rm I\\!R}$, where at most $n=2$. They are generally used to display the feature of a data distribution. Histograms are often used for comparison among several distributions, for instance, very importantly, histograms are used to compare measurements with expectations (e.g. simulations). \n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are \"binned\", i.e. the domain is divided in classes (bins), i.e. for the $i$th bin $x_i<x\\le x_{i+1}$ and the content of the bin (say $h(x)$) is  $h(x)=\\frac{\\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1}} f(x)}{x_{i+1}- x_{i}}$. Bins doesn't need to have the same size, i.e. it could well be that ($x_{i+1}- x_{i}) \\neq (x_{j+1}- x_{j})$ for $i\\neq j$. \n",
    "If the bin size is small, $h(x)\\simeq f(\\frac{x_{i+1}+x_{i}}{2})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)$ itself can be normalized ($\\int_{{\\rm I\\!R}^n} f(x) dx =1$) or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the number of bins and the bins sizes needs a lot of care. Typically the content of each $i$th bin, $N_i$, should be statistically significant, i.e. the corresponding Poisson uncertainty, $1/\\sqrt{N_i}$, should be small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often such uncertainty is worth being indicated, especially if the distribution is normalized or if the bin content comes from a simulation (and thus needed to be weighted). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scatter plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots are used to compare two quantities, mainly aiming at displaying possible correlations between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots can be binned or unbinned, the latter case is often prefered untill the number of point isn't too large. In that case the former is preferred, with a color code indicating the \"3rd dimension\", i.e. the relative population of each bin. This can be made into a \"contour plot\", i.e. with smoothened edges and color-coded levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Display of different population is also possible, marking the data points differently, e.g. with different colors or different markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of paramount importance is the condensation of the scatter plots into \"profiles\". The procedure runs as follow: data are binned along the $x$ (if you had to bin on the other variable, just invert the axes), for every bin take the mean and the standard deviation of the corresponding $y$ values, display those as data points and their error.\n",
    "These are also called \"box plots\".\n"

    "### Stateful Versus Stateless Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an important difference between the stateful (state-based, state-machine) and stateless (object-oriented, OO) interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we used import matplotlib.pyplot as plt to import the pyplot module from matplotlib and name it plt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all functions from pyplot, such as plt.plot(), are implicitly either referring to an existing current Figure and current Axes, or creating them anew if none exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could say that “plt.plot() is a state-machine interface that implicitly tracks the current figure!” In plain words, this means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The stateful interface makes its calls with plt.plot() and other top-level pyplot functions. There is only ever one Figure or Axes that you’re manipulating at a given time, and you don’t need to explicitly refer to it.\n",
    "* Modifying the underlying objects directly is the object-oriented approach. We usually do this by calling methods of an Axes object, which is the object that represents a plot itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This all boils down to the definition of `plt.plot()` as:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# matplotlib/pyplot.py\n",
    "def plot(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "    \"\"\"An abridged version of plt.plot().\"\"\"\n",
